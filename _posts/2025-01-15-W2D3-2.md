title: Team Task Lockout
---

In class today we had a team challenge.

We were split up into three teams of three. Each team had two computers that they were logged into and one that they are logged out of. The goal of the exercise was to login to that computer. Here are the steps we used:

## Step 1
We ran:
> ifconfig

This gave us our IP address and subnet mask.

## Step 2
we ran:
> sudo nmap -O 10.0.140.3/22

10.0.140.3 = our IP address
22 = calculated from subnet mask

This nmap command gave us a list of all the IPs on the network. We wrote down all of these IPs. Then we went through all of the logged in computers of all the groups and checked off those IPs on our list. This gave us 3 IPs left for the 3 computers we were locked out of. Next to find each computer's IP we turned off two of the 3 at a time and reran the nmap command, this told us each locked out computer's IP.

## Step 3
Next with the IP of our computer we downloaded a program called hydra to crack the password. But for hydra we need a list of passwords that it will use and go through, so we copied it from our teachers computer so we ran:
> scp rockyou.txt  csep-0@10.0.140.3:/home/csep-4/Desktop

This gave us the rockyou.txt file allowing us to then use hydra.

## Step 4
We ran:
> hydra -l csep-4 -P rockyou.txt ftp://10.0.140.5

And it gave us `iloveyou` as the password!
