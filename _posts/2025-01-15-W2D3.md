title: US response to malware from Chinese-backed hacker groups
---

The US Justice Department announced on January 14th, 2025, yesterday, that it had successfully removed malware known as PlugX from 4,200 computers. This attack was carried out by a group of Chinese-backed hackers called "Mustang Panda" and "Twill Typhoon." They used infected USB sticks that carried a piece of malware called "PlugX."

This attack vector they used is very interesting and I wonder how they pulled off plugging malicious USB sticks into people's computers. My first thought was that they left them on the sidewalk and hoped people would just put them into their computers. However, I'm not sure because [the article I read on routers](https://www.reuters.com/technology/cybersecurity/us-removes-malware-allegedly-planted-computers-by-chinese-backed-hackers-2025-01-14/) did not make it seem like that. I would be very interested to know specifically how they did it.
