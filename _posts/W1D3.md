# This Blog

Recently, I started a class at my school called Cybersecurity and Ethical Hacking, where we learn about the cybersecurity space. To document our journey, each student in the class is creating their own blog. Over the coming weeks, I will publish several posts about the different activities we are doing in the course. This website will change a lot as I learn how to improve its look and feel. For now, that's all. Until next time!
