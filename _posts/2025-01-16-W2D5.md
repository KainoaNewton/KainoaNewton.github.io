title: Popular online bill paying site leaks data of thousands of users

Recently Researcher Jeremiah Fowler found a huge database full of sensitive customer information unprotected online. Anyone who knew where to look had access to 240,000 unencrypted records. With some researc, he attributed it to Willow Pay.

This is just crazy, how can a company of this size not realize they’re database has no password? This was a massive oversight on Willow Pays end. Also, they should at least email Jeremiah to thank him for finding this issue, don’t just pretend like nothing happened.
